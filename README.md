# Event-based FAST Corner Detector
Python implementation of FAST (Event-based) Corner Detector.

The [original project](https://github.com/uzh-rpg/rpg_corner_events) was implemented in C++ by the Robotics and Perception Group of ETH Zurich.

This was a side project of mine to be used in my research.
